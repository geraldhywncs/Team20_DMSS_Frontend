### Project Structure and File Organization Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to follow when creating files in this project:

1. **Component File Format:**
   - Components should be written in JSX format.
   - Exceptions include `App.js` and `index.js`.

2. **Shared Components:**
   - Store shared components in the `shared` folder within the `components` directory.
   - Example: `src/components/shared/Navbar`.

3. **CSS File Organization:**
   - Place global CSS styles in the `App.css` file.
   - Custom CSS for individual components should be stored in the `styles` folder based on the component name.
     - Example: `src/styles/ComponentName.css`.

4. **Constants Component:**
   - Create a separate `constants` component to store hardcoded variables and strings.
   - Example: `src/constants/constants.js`.
